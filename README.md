## About

ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone! I'm Mahima Chacko, a junior at Drexel University pursing a BS in Software Engineering with a minor in Data Science, graduating in December 2025.

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently working part-time as a Software Developer at Susquehanna International Group on the Instruments team, managing master data and developing software solutions with technologies like C#, .NET, SQL. I'll be returning for my third co-op to expand my understanding of financial instruments and to further enhance my development skills in a professional environment.

ðŸ’»\
During my first co-op, I worked as a Software Developer at Susquehanna on the Corporate Systems team, focusing on internal applications. A key accomplishment was developing a filtering system with C# and ASP.NET to categorize and highlight over 3,000 points across 8 locations.

For my second co-op, I worked as a Software Developer at Susquehanna on the Instruments team, where I developed console applications and services to manage reference data. Notable accomplishments include building pipelines to publish over 1 million instruments, analyzing and comparing large data sets from diverse sources, creating an API in GraphQL to dynamically expose this data, and enhancing microservice communication through a signaling system built with C#, .NET, and RabbitMQ.

âŒ¨ When I'm not coding, I'm probably building a mechanical keyboard or looking for more sneakers
